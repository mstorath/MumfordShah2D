# Edge preserving image restoration based on the Mumford-Shah model
This repository contains algorithms for edge preserving image restoration based on the Mumford-Shah model.
This is an implementation of the methods described in the paper

K. Hohm, M. Storath, A. Weinmann,
An algorithmic framework for Mumfordâ€“Shah regularization of inverse problems in imaging,
Inverse Problems 31 (11), 115011

## Applications examples
### Edge preserving smoothing of vector-valued images

   - Supports smoothing of vector-valued images (e.g. multispectral images, feature images)
   - Linear complexity in number of color channels
   - No discretization of color space required

### Inpainting

## Quickstart:
   - Run the script "setPath.m", it should set all necessary paths
   - For best performance, increase Java heap space in the Matlab preferences (MATLAB - General - Java heap memory)
   - Run a demo from the Demos folder
